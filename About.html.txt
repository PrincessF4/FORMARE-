<div style="max-width:900px;margin:0 auto;font-size:18px;line-height:1.8">
<p>Welcome to <strong>FORMARE</strong> – a high fashion technology brand that's redefining the future of clothing. We create custom fit clothing that's designed for real bodies, not the other way around. Our mission is to bridge the gap in the market for those who have been overlooked by mainstream brands.</p>

<div style="border-left:4px solid var(--accent);background:#fff7f5;padding:18px;margin:28px 0;border-radius:6px">
<h3 style="margin-top:0">Breaking False Advertising</h3>
<p>Let's be honest: "one size fits all" is false advertising. Every body is unique, and fashion should celebrate that, not ignore it. FORMARE exists to challenge this outdated approach and provide solutions for people who aren't seen by mainstream brands.</p>
</div>

<p>As a high fashion technology brand, we combine cutting-edge AI and advanced 3D body scanning technology with style and sophistication. We've partnered with leading fashion brands to bring you a seamless shopping experience that adapts to your exact measurements, style preferences, and body shape.</p>

<div style="background:#f5f7f8;padding:18px;border-radius:8px;margin:24px 0">
<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>To create a world where everyone can express their style with confidence, knowing that their clothes are custom-made to fit their unique shape. We're not just changing how clothes fit – we're transforming who gets to participate in high fashion.</p>
</div>

<p>Through our partnerships with brands like ZARA, UNIQLO, H&M, ASOS, and many more, we offer you access to thousands of styles that can be customized to your exact measurements. No more guessing sizes, no more exclusion, no more settling for ill-fitting clothes – just custom fit clothing that celebrates your individuality.</p>

<p>Join us on our journey to make fashion more inclusive, sustainable, and personal. Because at FORMARE, we're bridging the gap between high fashion and technology to ensure everyone has access to clothing that truly fits.</p>
